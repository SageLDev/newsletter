# newsletter instructions
You need to make a .env file and add your API keys and list links as follows:
* The curly brackets are only to show you where to put your specific info,
ignore them but every other character is necessary for the code to work.

APIKEY={username}:{YourApiKey}

TARGETURL=https://{server}.api.mailchimp.com/3.0/lists/{list_id}

* Your username can be whatever you want, but the API key must match perfectly.
* Your server is the last section of your API key.
